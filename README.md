Bootstrap based landing page with enhancements for LibraryBox v2.0

This project is about using the LibraryBox project to deliver a presentation of materials relating to controversial
issues in the Latter-day Saint community. Many of these issues have been admirably summarized in the now-famous "Letter
to a CES Director" where the Director of an Church Education System Institute asked Jeremy Runnells to explain the
issues Runnells was having with Mormon history and doctrine in an attempt to help him resolve his concerns. Runnells
assembled all of the unresolved issues that had impacted his faith into a massive letter to the Institute Director.
While still unanswered, the letter itself, due to its quick summarization of nearly every issue currently plaguing
American LDS culture, quickly spread through the Internet with such energy that Runnells eventually republished it as a
website ((CESLetter.com)[http://cesletter.com/]).

While Runnells himself has kept his activities relating to the word of doubting Mormonism to his own website, the use of
the website's address has become something of a counter-cultural slogan among doubting and former Mormons. It has become
popular to simply leave the website address in conspicuous or inconspicuous locations to advertise it, and the letter
has continued to receive attention from these efforts. Runnells himself does not promote this use of the website, but he
has also indicated that he cannot and will not control the reaction his letter has caused among others except to
encourage civility and honesty. Attempts to trick people into visiting the website or read the letter are not helpful or
kind.

My own personal preference has been for the increasingly popular practice of broadcasting an SSID from a mobile phone's
tethering options with the name of "CESLetter.com" or so on. However, this practice just shares the website name and if
a connection is made by others it wastes tethering allotments or doesn't even allow access to the Internet at all.

The CESLetterBox project is an attempt to provide some use to this practice of sharing the website address via SSID by
using the PirateBox/LibraryBox project to build a private network under the SSID of "CESLetterBox" that provides a
number of resources for anyone who voluntarily wishes to connect to it. These resources are planned to be:

 * A mobile-ready HTML version of Jeremy Runnells's "CES Letter"
 * A mobile-ready HTML version of his "Debunking FAIR's Debunking of the CES Letter"
 * A copy of the LDS standard works (so that the private network provides some actual utility to LDS members who do not
   currently wish to peruse other materials)
 * Documents from LDS publication history that are often difficult to obtain (various BYU speeches, LDS General
   Conference remarks, old pamphlets, etc)

Other resources that are planned but may be dropped for reasons of space or functionality include:

 * Old LDS videos (may be dropped for reasons of space, possibly to be shared via the project website or torrent)
 * A copy of the FAIRMormon wiki (a static copy would certainly fit, but a true PHP-powered wiki with a MySQL backend is
   certainly beyond the intended scope of the PirateBox's lightweight lighttpd server. Without a PHP backend I am
   uncertain of how search functionality could be duplicated.)
